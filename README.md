# Mini RAG Chatbot

## Project Description

Mini RAG Chatbot is a FastAPI-based application that allows users to ask questions about the contents of uploaded PDF policy documents.  
The project loads PDFs, splits the text into chunks, generates embeddings using OpenAI, and performs semantic search to find relevant text segments.  
Answers are generated by a chat model (GPT-4o-mini) with streaming responses for fast user experience.  
Additionally, the source PDF document for each answer is provided.
